# Data Analysis and Insights Project
This project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing various health-related variables. The dataset includes information on mental health, physical activity, smoking habits, COVID-19 status, demographic characteristics, and more.

# Key Features:
Data Cleaning: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data types appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques, we explore relationships between variables and identify patterns within the data.
Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests are conducted to validate assumptions and test the significance of observed differences.
Predictive Modeling: Machine learning models are built to make predictions or classifications based on the data.
Insights and Interpretation: Findings from the analysis are interpreted to extract actionable insights and inform decision-making processes.
Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook: Used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration platform for managing project code and documentation.
# Usage:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-project.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd data-analysis-project
Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file and follow along with the analysis steps.
